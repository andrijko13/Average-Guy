## General
This repository holds the source files for a fully functioning and complete version of a game made for iOS and published by Andriy Suden and Viktor Kornyeyev throughout the 2013-2014 years. The game was taken down at the discretion of the developers, and the source code is made available through this repository. Although the intended use for the code is for learning purposes, it may be used, changed, and redistributed so far as the licensing on the product stays the same. Although the code and the graphics were made by the Developers, the 00 Starmap Truetype font and the POL-clouds-castle-short sound file are not original works and were downloaded from online repositories.

## Usage
This code is written for the iOS platform, and is intended to be compiled with the XCODE IDE. Although the source files are given, additional setup may be needed and will be described here. Should any problems arise in the building the project, feel free to leave an issue request.
